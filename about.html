        <p>"Unbearable to the soul" is the meaning of Thomas’s tragedy, a thirty years old man who finds out to be affected by an early-onset of Alzheimer disease, inherited from his mother, Alma, to whom he is devoting his last thoughts while going through frustrating hallucinations due to his disease, about which he is informed by Alvise, his mother’s same psychiatrist.</p>
        <p>Being still partially aware of his irreversible health conditions, Thomas begins to recall some moments of his life, above all those spent with his wife Nadia and his son-in-law Angelo; importantly, they both stands for what he defines "the two Suns that never go down" and a unique "cure from loneliness", which is the only true disease in Thomas’s life. Indeed, ten years before, Thomas was actually Mara, a twenty-one years old woman dead tired by a gender identity disorder, temporarily overcome with a hormone cure thanks to which she became "her own twin": Thomas.</p>
        <p>Moreover, before going under surgery, Mara had recorded her voice on a cassette in order to pour out and, contemporarily, preserve truth about her hated being. Therefore, overwhelmed by his-her memories, Thomas-Mara decides to listen to that cassette, which he-sheh as never dared to listen to and, at the very end, he-she adds his-her last moments of lucidity and ultimately destroys every single object-memory in his bedroom but one: the cassette.</p>
